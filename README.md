# DefenseAssetManagement

The solution is working as it is, see demo bellow. When building 3 projects are setup to start:

1. the websocket server (comms)
2. the command center UI (command)
3. the soldier registration UI (base)

# Prerequisite

Publish the database project from the solution to local MSSQL server DAM db before running the app.

## TODO

1. MVVC design
2. Unit tests
3. End-to-end integration test
